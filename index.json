[{"content":"Here I\u0026rsquo;ll try to write the post I wish I\u0026rsquo;d read before I started writing RFCs at work. I\u0026rsquo;ll start by providing some motivation for RFCs, then go over my current process for writing them, as well as provide a template.\nThis isn\u0026rsquo;t by any means a formal specification for writing RFCs. If anything, it\u0026rsquo;s just a loose framework I\u0026rsquo;ve found useful over the past couple of years. I\u0026rsquo;m also writing this as a reference for myself in the future, but hoping it\u0026rsquo;s useful for someone out there. It took me a while to appreciate the value of RFCs, but now I consider them one of the helpful tools I use regularly - so if you\u0026rsquo;ve never written an RFC, I hope when you\u0026rsquo;re finished reading this post you\u0026rsquo;ll feel confident enough to invest the time in one next time you get the chance. If you\u0026rsquo;re an RFCs veteran, maybe this will give you a different perspective on them, and if you have tips, please do share them!\nHold on - what\u0026rsquo;s an RFC? RFC stands for \u0026ldquo;Request for Comments\u0026rdquo;. It\u0026rsquo;s a structured document written in natural language explaining a proposal. Most of the time, RFCs are written for technical proposals, but it could just as well be used to propose a change in an organizational process, for example.\nWhy? I\u0026rsquo;ve found 3 main benefits of writing RFCs. They are each related with each general stage of the decision-making process: before, during and after. In short, I value that they facilitate an upfront analysis of the change and its implications, they encourage asynchronous collaboration and thoughtful discussion, and serve as a future reference to understand how and why the decision was made.\nIn a healthy organization, this all should also mean you\u0026rsquo;ll end up spending less time than if you had just dove right into coding. It often seems counter-productive, but after investing time into writing a good RFC the path forward should hopefully be clearer and smoother in many ways.\nBefore: Upfront analysis Writing an RFC requires you to explore the problem and the solution spaces thoroughly. The problem might be something you discovered (e.g. a frequently-run query\u0026rsquo;s performance has degraded) or something given to you (e.g. a use-case discovered by the Product or Design team that the product should support). Nevertheless, the problem itself and the requirements stemming from it should be thoughtfully broken down.\nThis problem description and list of functional and non-functional requirements will come in handy when pondering the different alternatives to solve the problem. They effectively restrict the solution space, guiding you to the optimal - which might not be the \u0026ldquo;ideal\u0026rdquo; - solution.\nAt this point it\u0026rsquo;s very important to identify co-authors, collaborators and stakeholders, as well as your audience.\n Co-authors are people who will actively work on writing the RFC with you, committing time to thinking about it or parts of it. Collaborators are people who can guide you or help you bounce ideas off. E.g. a member of a team who owns a subsystem your code will need to interact with, or a member of the product team who can help you understand the underlying use cases better. Stakeholders are any folks who will be impacted by the RFC\u0026rsquo;s implementation. It\u0026rsquo;s a naturally \u0026ldquo;open\u0026rdquo; group that might include contributors who will need to prioritize new work, their managers, customers that are waiting for a certain feature, etc. Your audience is the set of people you intend to get feedback from. It\u0026rsquo;s crucial that you identify them early as it will determine the style of writing you should use, the type of additional material you should include (such as diagrams, code snippets, or wireframes). If you fail to establish your audience, it will become harder for them to give you high-quality feedback on your RFC. Comments will usually be around asking you to explain something better or adding more context. These  I\u0026rsquo;ve found the things I described in this section to help in reducing the risk (both in quantity as well as types) associated with your proposal.\nThe first risk dimension is resource utilization. If your RFC is approved, you\u0026rsquo;ll have a better idea of what needs to be done, who should do it, and how long it will take. On the other hand, if it\u0026rsquo;s rejected, you won\u0026rsquo;t have wasted your valuable time working on a potentially-complex project only to find out it wasn\u0026rsquo;t needed. Arguably our work as programmers isn\u0026rsquo;t to write as much code as possible, but to minimize the amount of code that needs to be written.\nThe second is change management. Your proposal will inevitably affect the system it modifies. Having thought about the problem and solution in such a deep way will help you see how implementing your RFC will impact other components and users, making coming up with a migration strategy an easier task.\nThe third is impact on people. If you\u0026rsquo;re writing an RFC, chances are the problem you\u0026rsquo;re tackling isn\u0026rsquo;t a trivial one. As stated above, it will probably require direct changes in other components or systems and a timeline for rolling out the changes (migration). This means you will need to get the people responsible for those components to approve it. An RFC provides a great space to collaborate with them until everyone is onboard - if they have doubts, you can add more context so that everything\u0026rsquo;s clearer. If they spot a flaw in your understanding of the way other components work, you can reassess and come up with a better alternative. By the time your RFC has been approved by all the relevant people, they\u0026rsquo;ll have a clear picture of what their role (or their teams' role) will be, and plan accordingly.\nDuring: (Asynchronous) collaboration Some RFCs are simple - everyone is aware of the problem, and the solution is small in scope with a clear plan for execution. Some are complex, and might require several people to be written and reviewed. In those cases, getting everyone on a video call will most likely be a sub-optimal way to get everyone\u0026rsquo;s thoughts. I find the most efficient way to write and review RFCs is with tools that enable asynchronous communication.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re collaborating with someone on authoring the document, it allows each of you to write and contribute when you\u0026rsquo;re the most productive. Furthermore, writing RFCs usually requires that you step away, draw diagrams, read existing code and sketch solutions.\nFor the reviewers, it gives them time to read the whole document, take notes and think of insightful suggestions or meaningful questions. In my experience, this is way more effective than forcing someone to come up with an opinion on the spot. As an author, it also helps a lot to really digest the comments on your RFC, to prevent misunderstandings or spam. If you or someone uses the comments section of a shared document as a rapid-fire chat, people will tune off and ignore the conversation altogether.\nAdditionally, RFCs decouple definition from execution. The authors don\u0026rsquo;t necessarily need to be the ones to implement the solution described in it, reducing the bus factor in the team. Consider the alternative, where no RFC was written, and the person in charge switches teams or leaves the company altogether. Reading (sometimes, \u0026ldquo;deciphering\u0026rdquo;) the code they left behind is usually more time-consuming.\nAfter: Future reference After the RFC has been implemented, it\u0026rsquo;s still an invaluable resource, as people can refer back to it if they have questions about why things were done the way they were done. Sometimes, even the basic question of why they were done, regardless of the specific approach taken, isn\u0026rsquo;t obvious at all.\nIn such a dynamic (to put it lightly) industry, people will switch teams, and they will leave companies. And so will you, probably! Coming into a new team and having a set well-written RFCs for the most relevant parts is a godsend.\nAnother minor - but still important - side-effect of this is making it easier for folks who joined the team recently to empathize with employees with a longer tenure. It can be easy judge someone harshly when you see a part of the codebase they contributed that doesn\u0026rsquo;t make sense to you. Often, \u0026ldquo;bad\u0026rdquo; code can\u0026rsquo;t be taken at face value, and RFCs help with that. If the requirements were recorded in it, they can say a lot about the context it was written in, and the constraints that limited the implementation.\nWhen? In time, you\u0026rsquo;ll instinctively know when to invest time into writing RFCs. However, a good rule of thumb is to go over each of the above reasons for writing one (upfront analysis, collaboration, future reference) and think whether any will be valuable to you (or future you!). If at least one of them seems like a good thing to have, chances are it\u0026rsquo;ll be time well spent. It\u0026rsquo;s easy to dismiss writing RFCs if your team is small and everyone is on the same page about what needs to be done. However, you\u0026rsquo;ll be surprised at how often your assumptions about the way something works - or the ways it can be changed - turn out to be wrong. When that happens, it\u0026rsquo;s usually way better if you\u0026rsquo;re just writing a document, instead of at the last commit of a huge pull request. Similarly, teams grow and change, and people forget. If your company is small now, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean it will remain so forever. If it starts growing, you might need to hire people at an increasing rate, and RFCs will help them hit the ground running when they join. Also, when someone new asks you \u0026ldquo;what were you thinking when you added this feature?!\u0026rdquo;, you can point them to the RFC and not worry about having to keep every detail in your mind.\nSomething to keep in mind though is that not every problem needs an RFC. Some problems are just small, or the solution is obvious, or self-contained, or not controversial at all. In those cases, clear commit messages and a comprehensive cover letter for your pull request will go a long way in documenting the change. When someone wants to find out more about a certain section of the code, they can use git blame and read them.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t think there are mathematical, objective rules to know when or when not to invest your time in an RFC. If in doubt, talk to your team and get a feel for what their expectations are.\nHow? When it\u0026rsquo;s time to get to work, here\u0026rsquo;s a loose strategy I\u0026rsquo;ve used, based on the above.\n Assess the problem and solution spaces - is an RFC needed? Identify co-authors, collaborators, stakeholders, audience. Start writing! Take a look at the template. Share it and get feedback. When all feedback has been addressed, make sure your proposal has been generally approved. Implement.  Let me expand on 4. \u0026amp; 5. When sharing an early draft, you\u0026rsquo;ll get a lot of feedback on the form, like a note you forgot to remove or requests to add visual material, expand on an idea, etc. If a lot of people review it simultaneously at that stage, you\u0026rsquo;ll get a lot of similar comments. If readers perceive your RFC as a very \u0026ldquo;dirty\u0026rdquo; draft, they might not read it all (or at all). The idea is to refine these early on with a group of people that care a lot about the RFC, like your team or your manager. With those comments out of the way, you can expand the group of reviewers. The new round of comments should hopefully focus more on the content.\nWith regards to getting an RFC approved, it depends on the implicit or explicit agreements or policies within your organization. Some teams require sign-offs (e.g. reviewers mark the document as approved), while others may interpret as approval the lack of outstanding feedback after a couple review rounds. It\u0026rsquo;s all about communicating expectations effectively.\nClosing remarks Lastly, I think it\u0026rsquo;s worth mentioning that the most important part of the whole process is to keep an open mind. It\u0026rsquo;s a Request for Comments. You\u0026rsquo;re actively asking other people to review and critique your proposal. Some folks will like it a lot, while others might not. While the former might feel good, I\u0026rsquo;ve found that it\u0026rsquo;s the latter that really help, assuming good faith and that no one\u0026rsquo;s gatekeeping anything (if you suspect that\u0026rsquo;s not the case, you might have a big culture problem on your hands!).\nIf someone isn\u0026rsquo;t convinced with your RFC, it might be that you haven\u0026rsquo;t considered other alternatives. In some cases, someone will reveal a major flaw in your RFC, causing its overall rejection. This might feel disheartening, but it\u0026rsquo;s actually a great outcome! That person just saved you from wasting time pursuing an endeavor that wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have ended well. Go back to the drawing board, and if possible, try to get them involved so you can come up with an airtight solution.\n","permalink":"http://0x5d.github.io/posts/rfcs/","summary":"Here I\u0026rsquo;ll try to write the post I wish I\u0026rsquo;d read before I started writing RFCs at work.
