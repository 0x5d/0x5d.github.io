I appreciated the author&amp;rsquo;s decision to assume his target audience to be people who had just finished The Book, making it sort of an expansion or a Level II.

I&amp;rsquo;ll start by providing some motivation for RFCs, then go over my current process for writing them and provide a template that you can use.

I&amp;rsquo;m also writing this as a reference for myself in the future, but I hope it&amp;rsquo;ll be valuable for you too.</description></item></channel></rss>
