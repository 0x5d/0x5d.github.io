I read The Book and I&amp;rsquo;m in the middle of reading Rust for Rustaceans (my notes so far ), but after doing a couple of very small exercises and projects I wanted to do something more rusty.
So on Sundays, in between espressos and with very good company, I started writing an external sort.
This is the 1st post in a series, where I cover the code that generates the data to be sorted.</description></item><item><title>Notes on Rust For Rustaceans, Pt. 1</title><link>http://0x5d.github.io/posts/rust-for-rustaceans/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jun 2024 20:19:47 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://0x5d.github.io/posts/rust-for-rustaceans/</guid><description>Intro I&amp;rsquo;m really enjoying reading Jon Gjenset &amp;rsquo;s Rust for Rustaceans . I appreciated the author&amp;rsquo;s decision to assume his target audience to be people who had just finished The Book , making it sort of an expansion or a Level II.
However, I found it light on contrasting examples, as well as images. I&amp;rsquo;m more of a visual learner, so I find them very useful to understand what&amp;rsquo;s right (or wrong), or to help me create a mental model of a concept being described.</description></item><item><title>On writing RFCs</title><link>http://0x5d.github.io/posts/rfcs/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Feb 2023 15:11:47 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://0x5d.github.io/posts/rfcs/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ll write the post I wish I&amp;rsquo;d read before I started writing RFCs at work. I&amp;rsquo;ll start by providing some motivation for RFCs, then go over my current process for writing them and provide a template that you can use.
This post isn&amp;rsquo;t by any means a formal specification for writing RFCs. If anything, it&amp;rsquo;s a loose framework I&amp;rsquo;ve found helpful over the past couple of years. I&amp;rsquo;m also writing this as a reference for myself in the future, but I hope it&amp;rsquo;ll be valuable for you too.</description></item></channel></rss>
